Repo of my walkthrough of the Haskell Wikibook "[Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours][wyas]".

The book is included as .pdf and the code should compile at every commit.. i hope ;)

**Build**

    git clone git://github.com/mugenken/schemeIn48h.git
    cd schemeIn48h
    cabal configure
    cabal build
